# EMSC4033-Project
My solo project for EMSC4033


Welcome to my Git repository for Ocean Mapping, for Marine Scientists with limited knowledge on Python programming.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a Notebook tutorial for creating maps using specific functions that allow you to specify the location and place a marker where you collected scientific data from, such as coral samples. Following this Notebook will introduce you to the world of python programming with the popular Cartopy package. You will learn how a simple map can be made and input your own data to personalise the output. 


To get started please ‘fork’ or copy the repository so you can test, experiment, and run the Notebook with freedom to personalise the code. Within this repository you will find the following files:

•	**Ocean_maps.ipynb**: this module will generate the maps for the location of your scientific samples.

•	**emma’s_project_plan**: where you can read all about my inspiration, process and complications in developing this project.

•	three sets of png and pdf files that are the output files of my notebook, the notebook produces these files with example variables that the user can implement through running the notebook and following the instructions.



Instructions on how to produce, modify and personalise the maps are contained within the docstrings above each function.


Enjoy!
